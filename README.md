# Boombox

![Hackatime](https://hackatime-badge.hackclub.com/U08D22QNUVD/boombox)

A website based on the kurzgesagt fandom and has silly easter eggs and stuff. Trust me. It does not do what you expect.

## Features

- Quizzes
- Plays random clips from kurzgesagt videos
- Random number generator for how many megatonnes of TNT you will launch at an innocent birb

## How to use?

Just go to the [website](https://boombox.akaalroop.com) and have fun!
